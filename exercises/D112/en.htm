<p>You are learning bitwise operation. Write a program to help you calculate various types of bitwise operations.</p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The only line of input contains two integers $A$ and $B$, separated by a space. ($0 \le A, B \le 100,000$)</p>

<p>On the first line output their bitwise OR.
<br>On the second line output their bitwise AND.
<br>On the third line output their bitwise XOR.</p>
