<p>Write a program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and determine the person's weight status.</p>

<p>The Body Mass Index can be calculated by the formula $BMI = \cfrac{w}{h^2}$, where $w$ is the weight (in kg) and $h$ is the height (in m) of a person.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width: auto">
	<tr><th></th><th>Weight Status Classification</th>
	<tr><td>$BMI \lt 18.5$</td><td>\texttt{Underweight}</td>
	<tr><td>$18.5 \le BMI \lt 23.0$</td><td>\texttt{Normal}</td>
	<tr><td>$23.0 \le BMI \lt 25.0$</td><td>\texttt{Overweight}</td>
	<tr><td>$BMI \ge 25.0$</td><td>\texttt{Obese}</td>
</table>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The input consists of two numbers with one decimal place, $w$ and $h$, in a line separated by spaces.
<br>You may assume that $40 \le w \le 160$, $1.5 \le h \le 2.0$.</p>

<p>On the first line, output the Body Mass Index rounded to three decimal places, you must output exactly 3 digits after the decimal point. On the second line, output the weight status classfied.</p>
